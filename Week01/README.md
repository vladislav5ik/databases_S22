### Task requirements
- The university offers one or more programs.
- A program is made up of one or more courses.
- A student must enroll in a program.
- A student takes the courses that are part of her program.
- A program has a name, a program identifier, the total credit points required to graduate, and the year it commenced.
- A course has a name, a course identifier, a credit point value, and the year it commenced.
- Students have one or more given names, a surname, a student identifier, a date of birth, and the year they first enrolled. We can treat all given names as a single object—for example, “John Paul.” o When a student takes a course, the year and semester he attempted it are recorded. When he finishes the course, a grade (such as A or B) and a mark (such as 60 percent) are recorded.
- Each course in a program is sequenced into a year (for example, year 1) and a semester (for example, semester 1).
