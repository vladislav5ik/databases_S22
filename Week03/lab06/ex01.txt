SELECT distinct sname FROM catalog 
INNER JOIN parts ON catalog.pid = parts.pid
INNER JOIN suppliers ON catalog.sid = suppliers.sid
WHERE parts.color = 'Red'

SELECT distinct catalog.sid FROM catalog 
INNER JOIN parts ON catalog.pid = parts.pid
INNER JOIN suppliers ON catalog.sid = suppliers.sid
WHERE parts.color = 'Red' or parts.color = 'Green'

union select sid
from suppliers
where suppliers.address = '221 Packer Street';

4)Find the sids of suppliers who supply every red or (AND) green part.
SELECT sid 
	FROM catalog 
	WHERE pid IN (SELECT p1.pid 
				  FROM parts as p1 
				  WHERE color = 'Red')
GROUP BY sid 
HAVING COUNT(sid) = (SELECT COUNT(p2.pid) 
                     FROM parts as p2 
                     WHERE color = 'Red')
intersect  SELECT sid 
	FROM catalog 
	WHERE pid IN (SELECT p1.pid 
				  FROM parts as p1 
				  WHERE color = 'Green')
GROUP BY sid 
HAVING COUNT(sid) = (SELECT COUNT(p2.pid) 
                     FROM parts as p2 
                     WHERE color = 'Green')

5)Find the sids of suppliers who supply every red part or supply every green part.
SELECT sid 
	FROM catalog 
	WHERE pid IN (SELECT p1.pid 
				  FROM parts as p1 
				  WHERE color = 'Red')
GROUP BY sid 
HAVING COUNT(sid) = (SELECT COUNT(p2.pid) 
                     FROM parts as p2 
                     WHERE color = 'Red')
union SELECT sid 
	FROM catalog 
	WHERE pid IN (SELECT p1.pid 
				  FROM parts as p1 
				  WHERE color = 'Green')
GROUP BY sid 
HAVING COUNT(sid) = (SELECT COUNT(p2.pid) 
                     FROM parts as p2 
                     WHERE color = 'Green')

6)Find pairs of sids such that the supplier with the first sid charges more for some part than the supplier with the second sid .
select distinct c1.sid, c2.sid
from catalog c1, catalog c2
where c1.sid  != c2.sid and c1.pid = c2.pid and c1.cost > c2.cost

7)Find the pids of parts supplied by at least two different suppliers.
select distinct c1.pid
from catalog c1, catalog c2
where c1.sid  != c2.sid and c1.pid = c2.pid

8)find the average cost of the red parts and green parts for each of the suppliers
SELECT sid, avg(cost)
	FROM catalog 
	WHERE pid IN (SELECT p1.pid 
				  FROM parts as p1 
				  WHERE p1.color = 'Red' or p1.color = 'Green')
group by sid

9)find the sids of suppliers whose most expensive part costs $50 or more
SELECT distinct sid
	FROM catalog 
	where cost >= 50.0
